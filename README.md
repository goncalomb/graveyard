# graveyard #

A place where code comes to die.

Unfinished projects, random scripts and code snippets. To be consumed in moderation.

This is my graveyard. Feel free to fork the repository, but **I'm not accepting Pull Requests**.

You can also use `gravedigger.php` to manage your own graveyard (CLI script).
